This repository contains two Java projects: a Shopping Complex system and a Banking Application. Both projects are built using core Java concepts and OOPS principles, showcasing inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.


1. Shopping Application
   
  The Shopping Application simulates a simple online shopping platform:
      Users can enter their username and start shopping.
      A list of products with prices is displayed.
      Users can select products and enter quantities to add to their purchase.
      The total price is calculated, and a 50% discount is applied automatically.
      After checkout, the final amount is displayed along with a thank-you message.
  Key Concepts Used:
      Classes and Objects
      Loops and Conditional Statements
      Basic Arithmetic Operations
      Scanner class for user input

   
3. Banking System
   
  The Banking System simulates basic banking operations and includes an Admin Portal:
      User Registration: New users can register with a unique username.
      Login System: Existing users can log in securely.
      Account Management: Users can add bank accounts (account number, name, type).
      View Account Details: Logged-in users can view their account information.
  Admin Portal (password protected):
      View all registered users
      View all bank accounts
      Delete users
      Delete accounts
 Key Concepts Used:
      Encapsulation with getters and setters
      Inheritance (future scalability)
      Static collections (ArrayList) to store users
      Admin authentication
      Modular structure with multiple methods
      Menu-driven console interaction


3.Tech Stack
